# Coffee Shop Customer Service Chatbot üöÄ‚òïÔ∏è
In the light of an AI project in our  generative AI course in aivancity under the supervision of marion schaffer, we were asked to develop a conversational agent and we decided to build a coffee  shop customer service agent which will be integrated later to a coffee shop mobile app 

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Customer Service Chatbot project! This repository contains the code, resources, and instructions to build an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance customer experiences in a coffee shop app. Leveraging the power of LLMs (Large Language models), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and RunPod's infrastructure, this chatbot can assist with taking orders, answering detailed menu queries, and providing personalized product recommendations‚Äîall within a React Native mobile app.

# üéØ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a smart, **agent-based chatbot** that can:
* Handle real-time customer interactions with the chatbot including orders.
* Answer questions about menu items, including ingredients and allergens through a **Retreival augmented Generation (RAG) system**.
* Provide personalized product recommendations through a **market basket analysis recommendation engine**.
* Guide customers through a seamless order process, ensuring accurate and structured order details.
* Block irrelevant or harmful queries using a Guard Agent for safe and relevant interactions.
